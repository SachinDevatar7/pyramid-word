# Pyramid-Word
Rest API is used to check whether a word is a pyramid word or not.

## Problem Statement 

**Write a web service that takes in a string and returns a boolean to indicate whether a word is a pyramid word. A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.**

*Examples: banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's. bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.*
